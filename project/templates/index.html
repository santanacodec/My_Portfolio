<p id="bio">Hello! My name is Edgar Santana and I am a developer based out of Atlanta, Ga. 
I started teaching myself how to code around 7 years ago and I fell in love with it so I decided to go back to school for it. I have now got my Associates degree in Computer Programming as well as a Java Developer Certificate from Gwinnett Technical College. I am currently a junior at Kennesaw State University going for my bachelor's in Computer Science and I am also working full-time. My skills range from front-end development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to Game Development (Unity, C#, C++) and much more which can be seen in my portfolio.</p>
